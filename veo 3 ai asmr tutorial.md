With your workspace ready, you’re set to start producing content efficiently.

## Step 2: Selecting ASMR Triggers

Triggers define your content. Popular options in [Veo 3 AI ASMR](https://asmrvideo.ai) include:

- **Whispers**: Soft-spoken instructions, personal attention, or guided meditation.  
- **Tapping**: Glass, wood, metal surfaces — layered for depth.  
- **Crinkling**: Paper, plastic, or textured fabrics.  
- **Ambient Sounds**: Rain, forest, ocean waves.  
- **Roleplay Scenarios**: Spa treatments, haircuts, gentle tutorials.

> Our approach: **pick 2-3 triggers per video** for clarity and a satisfying sensory experience.

## Step 3: Writing Your Script

A solid script is key:

- Keep sentences **short and repetitive** — it enhances relaxation.  
- Include **pauses** — silence is part of ASMR’s charm.  
- Use **sensory words** describing textures, sounds, and visuals.  
- Optional: personalize content by addressing the viewer directly.

Example:

> *Close your eyes. Feel the soft tapping on the wooden desk. Let the whispers guide you into a state of calm. Breathe slowly… inhale… exhale… you are completely relaxed.*
